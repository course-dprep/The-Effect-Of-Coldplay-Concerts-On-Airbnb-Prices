# Airbnb Prices during Coldplay Concert 

In our research we study the price changes of Airbnb's in different cities in the period of a Coldplay concert. We will look at the prices a period before, the period of the concert, and the period after the concert to study the price differences caused by the Coldplay concerts. Furthermore, we will look at the influence of the type of listing, and the influence of the distance between an Airbnb and the place of the concert on the relationship of the concert on the price of the Airbnb.

Since the tour of Coldplay started in March 2022 and will continue till July 2023, we are not able to study all cities. However, results of our study can help other cities by predicting prices of Airbnb's. The cities we will study are Mexico City, Dallas, and Chicago. 

We will use data about the listings from Airbnb retrieved by "http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data", and to find the concert dates we will use data from "http://songkick.com"
